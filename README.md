name of app:
well, this is a cab related app... and Uber has been copyrighted already... therefore, I call it CUber (not cuba though)

scenario:
a user wants to call a taxi / cab through an app.
The app provides information based on the user's criteria (e.g. location, cab quality, usb charger)
Payment is done on the app and order is settled
